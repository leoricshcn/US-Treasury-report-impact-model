1. **General Comments:**  
1) For re-openings, the maturity recorded is the maturity time at first issuance, not the time-until-maturity at the time of the re-opening.  
2) Not every document recorded information about re-openings. All explicitly stated information is recorded as Y/N, the rest recorded as NA.  
3) Saw a lot of information mentioning buybacks. Is this a focus/concern?  
2. **For Q2 2025:**  
1) In the Official Remarks, it is written: “Treasury plans to address any seasonal or unexpected variations in borrowing needs over the next quarter through changes in regular bill auction sizes and/or CMBs.” Yet the issuance of such CMBs and regular weekly bills are not specified in the Recommended Financing Table, nor anywhere else.  
2) No “Announcement date” was disclosed for any item specifically. Thus, data is recorded assuming all issuances are announced on the day of the Official Remarks (2025-04-30).  
3) The exact auction date was only disclosed for 3 items, the rest unknown.  
3. **For Q4 2012:**  
1) No “Announcement date” was disclosed for the two CMB issuances. Thus, data is recorded assuming those two issuances are announced on the day of the Official Remarks (2012-10-31).   
4. **For Q1 1990:**  
1) What happened in January 1990 is counted towards Q1 1990, but the tentative schedule could only be retrieved from the file from Q4 1989\. The Q1 1990 file only contains schedules going from February to April.  
2) The documents sometimes only provide a “sum amount” of borrowing from a certain type of bills (e.g. total cash raised from 2-year notes in this quarter), or the resulted “new cash” from an issuance. In that case the issued amount in each announcement/issuance cycle is unknown and marked NA.  
3) The entry is classified to quarters regarding its announcement date, instead of auction date.  
4) The announcement/issuance schedule and the amount issued on each date for the following types of bills was not reported: CMB, 3-month bills, 6-month bills  
5. **For Q3 2001:**  
1) The Letter to Secretary mentioned “A 2-year note of $13 billion in August”, yet no documentation disclosed any further information regarding this.  
2) Weekly issuance of 3-month, 4-month and 6-month bills are mentioned. Yet no other information regarding the announcement/issuance schedule or the issuance amount is made available.
